# Sales-Performance

#  Sales Performance Analysis Using Python & Google Colab
=============================================================

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance across different sales channels: **Social Media, Field Sales, and Tally Data**.  
The goal is to compare **weekly, monthly, and yearly sales**, evaluate employee and team performance, and assess  
investments in sales strategies.

##  Key Objectives
-  Compare **sales performance** across different sales teams.
-  Analyze **weekly, monthly, and yearly** sales trends.
-  Evaluate **return on investment (ROI)** for each team.
-  Identify **underperforming teams** and reasons for lower sales.

## 🗂 Dataset Description
The dataset consists of **1000+ records** with the following attributes:

| Column Name        | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Employee ID       | Unique identifier for each employee |
| Employee Name     | Name of the sales representative |
| Team             | Sales channel: **Social Media, Field Sales, or Tally Data** |
| Sales Channel    | The platform used for sales |
| Sales Amount     | Total sales made by the employee |
| Investment       | Investment made in sales efforts |
| Leads Generated  | Number of potential customers contacted |
| Conversion Rate  | Percentage of leads converted to sales |
| Target Met       | Whether the employee met their target (Yes/No) |
| Bonus Earned     | Bonus received based on performance |
| Year             | The year of sales |
| Date             | Date of the sales transaction |
| Week             | Week number in which sales occurred |

##  Data Analysis & Visualizations
This project includes various **visualizations** for better insights:
-  **Yearly Sales Trend** – Line graph showing total sales per year.
-  **Weekly Sales Trend** – A detailed analysis of sales trends per week.
-  **Team Performance Comparison** – Evaluating which team performs better.
-  **Investment vs. Sales** – Understanding ROI for each team.

##  Tech Stack & Tools Used
- **Google Colab** (for Python scripting & visualization)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and project hosting)

##  Steps to Run the Project
- 1️ Load the dataset into Colab.
- 2️ Run the code to analyze the data and generate visualizations.
- 3️ Upload updates back to GitHub using:
- Insights & Findings
- Social Media consistently outperforms Field Sales and Tally Data.
- Some teams have higher investment but lower sales, indicating inefficiencies.
- Weekly sales fluctuate, and peak sales often occur in certain weeks.

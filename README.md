# Sales-Performance

# 📊 Sales Performance Analysis Using Python & Google Colab
=============================================================

## 🔹 Project Overview
This project analyzes sales performance across different sales channels: **Social Media, Field Sales, and Tally Data**.  
The goal is to compare **weekly, monthly, and yearly sales**, evaluate employee and team performance, and assess  
investments in sales strategies.

## 📌 Key Objectives
- ✅ Compare **sales performance** across different sales teams.
- ✅ Analyze **weekly, monthly, and yearly** sales trends.
- ✅ Evaluate **return on investment (ROI)** for each team.
- ✅ Identify **underperforming teams** and reasons for lower sales.

- 📊 **Team Performance Comparison** – Evaluating which team performs better.
- 💰 **Investment vs. Sales** – Understanding ROI for each team.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools Used
- **Google Colab** (for Python scripting & visualization)
- **Pandas & NumPy** (for data preprocessing)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Git & GitHub** (for version control and project hosting)

## 🚀 Steps to Run the Project
1️⃣ Load the dataset into Colab.
2️⃣ Run the code to analyze the data and generate visualizations.
3️⃣ Upload updates back to GitHub using:
Insights & Findings
🔹 Social Media consistently outperforms Field Sales and Tally Data.
🔹 Some teams have higher investment but lower sales, indicating inefficiencies.
